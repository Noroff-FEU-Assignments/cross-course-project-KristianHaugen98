    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[Answer here. I think the client should know that they need to take action to be protected, in order for them to protect theire website. It is vital as a client to protect their informations, and overall for their users to feel safe and protected when using theire website. <br>
       You should always use a long and strong password, make a password that have an insane combination of symbols is good, because it will be hard or even imposible for the hackers to crack your password.<br> You should also use a authentication when loging in to your website. It's is an exstra layer of security when loging in to the website, to ensure that it is really you, thats trying to log in, and not a bot or an hacker.<br> Can't trust an public internet server. You dont know if the internet you are connected to is safe, when using an public internet. There is hackers that have a public internet open for everyone, just so they can steal informations from the useres. If you deside to work on your website, and you want to work outside or in a cafe, this is something you need to know about. So it is a good thing to be ''paranoid'', when it comes to web security.<br>You can use handy tools such as: https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/website-scanner this is a website Vulnerability scanner. This site will scan and tell you if your scaned website have any form of web security threats, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and cross-site request forgery. Those are are common web security threats to be aware of.<br> Your website should be using HTTPS insted of HTTP, because the HTTPS is more secure and the information is encrypted. example, you search https://google.com and you use the HTTPS, you as a user send a request to get the information needed to look and use google's website. Google responding and sending you the information you need to show the website. HTTP dosen't care about how the information is moving between the internet, it just do what they are told to do. But with HTTPS because it is encrypted, your sensitive information will be safe, like your password or creditcard information. The website can also send you sensitive information safely.  ]</p>
